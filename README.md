## Motivation
The idea started when I was preparing for GRE test, which requires a lot of vocabulary memorized. The popular vocabulary app at the time couldn't meet my study preference: Classifying words into multiple levels based on my familarity to them. This feature is crucial for those **who have different study plans for vocabularies tagged with different levels of familarity**. For example, I tend to put all my focus on those words that I always forgot first. After I feel more comfortable with them, I would then study those words that I am more familiar with. Therefore, I created this app that put emphasis on this feature.
